          <p>
            "Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that
            followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and
            gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact — particularly in
            the wake of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial
            success — that there weren't a whole lot of artists who weren't
            trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula.""
